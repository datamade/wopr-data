# W.O.P.R. Data

Scripts for creating and updating datasets for the [W.O.P.R. API](https://github.com/datamade/wopr-api).

There are 2 types of scripts: initializations (**init** directory) and
updates (**update** directory).  The initialization scripts are run
only once when a dataset is first added to WOPR.  The updates should
be run periodically when new snapshots of a dataset are downloaded.
The update scripts are generated automatically.

# Data

New datasets are actively being added to the WOPR API. We keep track of them in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au-2OHnpwhGTdGJzUWJ2SERwVXZLeDU4Y3laWFJvNEE&usp=sharing#gid=0)
