Scripts for creating and updating datasets for the W.O.P.R.

There are 2 types of scripts: initializations (**init** directory) and
updates (**update** directory).  The initialization scripts are run
only once when a dataset is first added to WOPR.  The updates should
be run periodically when new snapshots of a dataset are downloaded.
The update scripts are generated automatically.
